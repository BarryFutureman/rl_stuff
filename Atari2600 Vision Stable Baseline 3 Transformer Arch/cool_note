Pausing on this project, quite a bit of work needs to be done to make transformers models to work
with stable baselines3. It's not impossible, but will take some time. Will come back to play around with architectures.

What I have so far:
- remember to use a large n_steps, otherwise the training will not work well
- loading and saving models code is in base_class.py, issue is how to make the model a pretrained transformer
